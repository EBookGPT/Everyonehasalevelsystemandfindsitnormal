# Chapter 1: Understanding the Concept of Level Systems

Welcome to the first chapter of our book on "Everyone has a level system and finds it normal!". In this chapter, we will delve into the basic concept of level systems. 

As human beings, we are constantly striving to improve ourselves and the world around us. We set goals and work hard to attain them, hoping to climb the ladder of success. But have you ever thought about why we do this? 

To help us understand this concept better, we have a special guest in this chapter, Professor Jordan Peterson. He is a Canadian clinical psychologist and a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto. His book "12 Rules for Life" has gained widespread recognition and has been translated into over 50 languages.

Professor Peterson believes that level systems are a fundamental part of human nature. He argues that we are hardwired to seek out hierarchies and strive for success within them. According to Professor Peterson, level systems provide us with a sense of purpose and meaning in life, and help us to orient ourselves towards a better future.

In this chapter, we will explore the psychology behind level systems and their evolutionary origins. We will also look at different types of level systems, such as those in the workplace and in education. Through this, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of why we are driven to compete and succeed in level systems.

So, buckle up and get ready to dive into the fascinating world of level systems with us and Professor Jordan Peterson.
# Chapter 1: Understanding the Concept of Level Systems

Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson sat in their Baker Street office, contemplating their next case. The sound of the rain tapping against the window provided a soothing background noise, while the fire in the fireplace crackled warmly.

"Ah, here we are," said Holmes, picking up a newspaper from the table. "Dr. Watson, have you ever heard of the 'level system'?"

Watson shook his head, and Holmes continued: "Well, it appears that all around us, people unconsciously follow a hierarchy, a system that ranks individuals by their success and achievements. It is as if everyone is part of a game, working tirelessly to climb the ladder to success."

"Intriguing," replied Watson. "But what makes you bring this up, Holmes?"

"The fact that we have a curious case, Watson. A young man has been found dead in a prestigious law firm here in London, and all indications suggest that his death was caused by overworking and undue pressure from his superiors."

"With all due respect, Holmes, how does this relate to level systems?" asked Watson.

"It appears that our victim was not only subject to a level system in his workplace but also felt compelled to live up to the expectations of his family and the society around him, earning him a spot at the top of this hierarchy. This meant that he was under immense pressure, unable to handle the stress, leading to his untimely demise."

"But Holmes, doesn't everyone follow a level system? It's simply part of being human, to strive to be the best we can be," exclaimed Watson.

"Indeed, Watson, but it appears that our society has plummeted into a culture of toxic positivity, where people are expected to succeed at any cost, leading to burnout and overexertion," replied Holmes. 

At that moment, the doorbell rang, and in walked Professor Jordan Peterson.

"Gentlemen, I may be of assistance in your case. I believe that level systems are essential to human nature, providing us with a sense of purpose and orienting us towards a better future. However, it is our responsibility to ensure that these systems do not spiral out of control and become toxic."

Holmes nodded in agreement, "Indeed, Professor, we must learn to recognize when the pursuit of success leads us down a dangerous path. Gentlemen, let us move forwards and solve this case, ensuring that we uphold the values of a healthy level system within our society."

Together, the trio set out to solve the case, recognizing the importance of a healthy level system in both the victim's and our lives.
After a thorough investigation, Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson, and Professor Jordan Peterson concluded that the victim's death was caused by the toxic level system in his workplace and society. They highlighted the importance of recognizing when level systems become unhealthy, leading to burnout and mental health problems.

As Professor Peterson pointed out, level systems are essential to human nature, providing us with a sense of purpose and driving us towards a better future. However, it is our responsibility as individuals and as a society to ensure that these systems do not spiral out of control and cause harm.

Sherlock Holmes and his companions emphasized the need to uphold the values of a healthy level system within our society, where success is achieved through hard work and dedication, not at the cost of an individual's well-being. 

Overall, this case underscores the importance of understanding the concept of level systems and their role in our lives. By setting realistic goals, recognizing when level systems become toxic, and supporting each other's mental health, we can work towards a healthier and more productive society.
